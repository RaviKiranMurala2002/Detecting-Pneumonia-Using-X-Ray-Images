# Detecting-Pneumonia-Using-X-Ray-Images

This is my MAJOR PROJECT in my Final Year Graduation.

In this Project, I have been using Machine Learning Concept along with few technologies, those include Python Programming Language, HTML, CSS and NLTK. The Machine Learning Algorithm using here is nothing but Convolutional Neural Networks wherein Frameworks and libraries includes Keras, TensorFlow and VGG. For Front-end implementation, I have used PyQt5 GUI Framework.

The dataset is taken from KAGGLE, and I developed this project by taking reference from YOUTUBE TUTORIALS too.

The trained model can be stored in .h5 file.
